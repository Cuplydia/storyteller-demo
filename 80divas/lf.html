				<p>Lisa began her career with Luther Vandross. He was not only her first gig, but her longest. Lisa sang on every tour and album with Luther from the mid-80s until he stopped working, due a stroke which ended his recording career.
				</p>Luther was a world-class vocal producer and arranger, and known to only have quality talent behind him. He encouraged Lisa to pursue a solo career, as singers like Patti Labelle, David Bowie, and Roberta Flack had once pushed him.</p>
				<blockquote><cite>“He saw me in a way that I couldn’t see myself,” she once shared. “He made me feel like a diamond though I felt like a grain of sand.”</cite></blockquote>
					
				<p>Lisa found success with her 1991 debut album So Intense, which produced the Grammy Award–winning hit single <i>"How Can I Ease the Pain".</i>  However, the pressures that came with being a woman in entertainment-<b>to be thin and glamorous</b>-were overwhelming. She was more comfortable where she started, in the background.</p><br>
			  
				<p>Lisa Fischer is one artist happy she didn’t become a bigger solo success. Instead, she became a sought-after session vocalist and background singer including joining the Rolling Stones on tour in 1989.</p>

				<p>Lisa did finally get comfortable enough to launch a solo tour, but she performs now in draped, flowing garments, often in bare feet, always with bare face and natural hair. Easy, relaxed, in a way she can focus on the music and not the package.</p>
