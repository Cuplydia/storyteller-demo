	<h2>What is a DIVA?</h2>				
			  					
	<main>
		<p><b>A diva</b><i> (/ˈdiːvə/; Italian: [ˈdiːva])</i> is the Latin word for a goddess and can also refer to a celebrated female singer; a woman of outstanding talent in the world of opera, and by extension in theatre, cinema and popular music.</p>
		
		<p>Without a doubt, the 80s was one of the most significant decades for music history, and especially so for female singers.  With the growth of MTV, the 80's saw the explosion of solo female artists in Pop, such as Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Pat Benatar, Paula Abdul; to R&B including Chaka Kahn, Jodie Watley and Karen White.  Along with famous groups, such as The Pointer Sisters, The Bangles and the Go-Go's just to name a few.</p>
			
		<p>The 80's also generated powerhouse female R&B singers or Divas, who are talented artists and true innovators.  Although they never acheived the cross-over appeal of Whitney Houston or Janet Jackson, they remain true legends in the world of R&B! Below are three of my favorites:</p>
